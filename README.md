# Snakey


## Introduction
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat food that appears randomly on the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer. The player must navigate the snake without itself. The game ends when the snake touches or comes in contact itself. 


## Description

- **Development**: Developed using C++ in Code::Blocks.
- **Dependencies**: Requires `conio.h` to handle key inputs, which is specific to Windows systems. You can use any IDE or compiler that supports `conio.h` for handling key inputs.
- **Key Inputs**: The application currently supports detecting the inputs `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys (both uppercase and lowercase) for directional movement.
- **Future Work**: Currently working on integrating arrow key inputs into the source code.

## Features

- Recognizes `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`(uppercase and lowercase) keys for movement direction.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows (because `conio.h` is specific to Windows)
- **Compiler**: Any C++ compiler that supports `conio.h` (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
